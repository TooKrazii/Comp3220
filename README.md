# Project 3 - Prolog

We are given multiple conditions by which we have to solve a programming problem. After all of these conditions, the basis of the program is that it will tell us how we are supposed to make it through the rooms of this house and what rooms we will be entering and passing through in order to get to the designated final room. 

NOTE: Please ensure that you have GNU-Prolog installed on your computer before you begin this project.

#### Condition 1

  Given Condition: If I give the program a starting room and an ending room, if there is a phone ringing in the ending room,
the program should tell me how to get to that room (which rooms do I need to go through?).
  ___
  
#### Condition 2
  
  Given Condition: Alternatively, if I give the program a starting room and an ending room, and there is no phone ringing in
that room, the program should not return any output (actually, prolog should just print “no”).
  ___
  
#### Condition 3
  
  Given Condition: If I only give the program a starting room. The program should give me every possible sequence of rooms
that I could go through, starting from the starting room that I gave it, to reach any room with a phone
ringing.
  ___
  
#### Condition 4
  
  Given Condition: If I only give the program an ending room, if there is a ringing phone in that room, the program should
give me every possible sequence of rooms that I could go through (including multiple starting rooms, and
all sequences that start with each of those rooms), to reach that room. If there is no phone ringing, it
should simply return “no”.
  ___
  
#### Condition 5
  
  Given Condition: Finally, if I don’t give the program any starting or ending room, it should simply return every possible
sequence of rooms I must go through to reach all of the rooms with phones ringing (should be a lot!).
  ___
  
#### Room Layout

  We are provided with a room layout for the problem that will guide us as to how the building is laid out and assist with ensureing that we are programming correctly. From here, we are tasked with creating a code that matches the five conditions listed above and prints out the proper code showing us the trail of rooms we are guided through during our programming.
