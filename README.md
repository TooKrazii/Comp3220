# Project 2 - Scheme

We are given the example of a county fair that has a bucket ball game. Each player is given a bucket and the balls inside of said
bucket are given values. We are going to be tasked with writing a computer program in Scheme that will look at a given bucket
and determine how many points it's worth.

NOTE: Please ensure that you have DrRacket installed on your machine before beginning this project.
